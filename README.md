Pretty Slow Proxy Scraper
- Pretty Slow Python3 Proxy Scraper with following output:
 
1. Files with type as name e.g. "Socks4_Elite.txt" => Socks4 Elite type proxy, ez right?
2. BigList with all Proxys found "bigProxy.txt" sorts out Duplicated every now and then... (can be set in the Python File :D)

#### HF and remember: Stay Legal!

#### multiHit.py is way faster and outputs everything it gets to 'SyncList.txt'
